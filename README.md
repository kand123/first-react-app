Studio Ghibli Films

This is my first React app. I wanted to showcase the Studio Ghibli Films.
Deployed using Netlify Functions to retrieve API data from https://ghibliapi.herokuapp.com/#
UI elements from the MUI version 5 package

Final project requirements: 

1. Effectively use conditional logic and JavaScript array methods(e.g. Filter, Map, Reduce, Find) to render large lists.
2. Encapsulate your code as React functional components.
3. Work with command-line tools and NPM to create and manage your project within a real development toolset.
4. Allow communication between components using props and the Context API.
5. Present a form for user input that provides useful form validation and feedback for at least 3 data input items (e.g. name, password).
6. Create at least 5 custom components and use them within at least two of your other components.
7. Use a mix of CSS animations and Transition Component transitions to enhance some aspects of your project.
8. Connect to a server using Netlify functions and display retrieved data including at least 5 item details (accessed by details route) in your UI.
9. Provide at least 3 different routes with navigation between them using React Router.
10. Manage your application's general and signup/login Authentication state using Hooks and the Context API.
11. Structure, document, and deploy your final project code according to common industry practices.
