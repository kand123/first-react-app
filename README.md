Studio Ghibli Films

This is my first React app. I wanted to showcase the Studio Ghibli Films.

Deployed using Netlify Functions to retrieve API data from https://ghibliapi.herokuapp.com/#

UI elements from the MUI version 5 package--

Ways to interact with the UI using the useState hook:
Button that triggers modal for a film's plot summary
Clickable user rating (an MUI component) 
A Favorites button that will display all the films that the user has rated 4 or 5 stars

More features and styling to come!

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app)
